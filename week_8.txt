# Week 8 Notes

This week I mostly worked on adding support to the system so it is able to handle creating and editing configurations by the user.

The way this works is that each configuration is based on a group of edits, each of these edits contain a colour and an x and y co-ordinate for where the plinths are. 

The database keeps track of this and stores each configuration so it can be retrieved later.
