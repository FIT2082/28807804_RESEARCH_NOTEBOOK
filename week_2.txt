## Thoughts

I have been assigned to the Sensilab Plinths IoT Project with Cameron Lindsay and am very excited to get started.
I think this project will be lots of fun, and also teach me a lot about user experience and micro-controller programming.

## Technical Details

Not much to report this week, as our meeting has been set for Week 3 Monday.
More details to come.
