# Notes

During this week we largely focussed on finishing the project specification. As well as this Cameron created some mockups which will make developing the UI a lot easier. In addition I tested out changing the light colours via AJAX, which turned out to work quite well. 

We found we were able to store lists of urls and plinth ID's and with this data we could construct requests fairly easily. We also created an all button which allows a user to change all the plinths' colours at once. 
As this is the main requirement, it is pleasing to have this core functionality starting to come together so early in the project.
