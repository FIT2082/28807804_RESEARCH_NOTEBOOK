## Thoughts

After our inital meeting on Monday I was very keen to get started and after being granted access to the repo started looking at the code for the current system.
This runs on an Arduino and controls LED Strip lighting which is controllable via a web interface. Currently each plinth has its own web interface and is programmed through
a get request sent to the plinths HTTP server. 

We have scheduled another meeting for Thursday to get started on some ideas, as well as finalising the scope some more.
