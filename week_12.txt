# Week 12 Notes

This week was mainly dedicated to working on our poster and presentation. As well as recording a video for the presentation. We did a little bit of work polishing the UI as well in preparation for this project ending soon. Although Cameron and I may stay on for a bit to do some more work, as we are both really enjoying the project and want to do more than what we have already done for the system.
