# Notes

This week I created I did a lot of work on the backend. I created an endpoint to change any lights colour based from a uniform interface. This uses curl to send requests to the plinths.

I also created a method that returns the current status of all plinths in the database to a client. As well as this I wrote a php script to curl all plinths in the database and extract from their homepage their current status and update the database. 

The status is parsed via regex and then inserted into the database.
